# MiniMax Tic-Tac-Toe (C)

A compact, algorithm-focused Tic-Tac-Toe engine implemented in C featuring a Minimax search with alpha–beta pruning and targeted move ordering. The board size is configurable via `BOARD_SIZE` (default 3).

## Minimax-first overview

Core search is implemented with two mutually recursive functions representing the maximizing and minimizing plies:

- `miniMaxHigh(board, aiPlayer, depth, alpha, beta)`: maximizing side (AI)
- `miniMaxLow(board, aiPlayer, depth, alpha, beta)`: minimizing side (opponent)

Both return an integer score. Constants used throughout the engine (see `src/MiniMax/mini_max.c`):

- `AI_WIN_SCORE = 100`, `PLAYER_WIN_SCORE = -100`
- `TIE_SCORE = 0`
- `CONTINUE_SCORE = 1` (sentinel: game not terminal)
- `INF = INT_MAX`

Depth-based scoring tweaks terminal values to prefer quicker wins and delay losses:

- AI win at depth d → `AI_WIN_SCORE - d`
- AI loss at depth d → `PLAYER_WIN_SCORE + d`

### Optimizations that matter

- Alpha–beta pruning
  - Each node tracks `(alpha, beta)`; prune when `beta <= alpha`.

- Targeted move ordering
  - `moveWeight(row, col)` partitions moves into buckets before searching:
  - Weight 4: center (distance 0 from center; for even boards this yields one of the four central squares).
  - Weight 3: diagonal squares OR Manhattan distance 1 from center.
  - Weight 2: remaining squares.
  - `orderMoves(...)` concatenates the buckets (4 → 3 → 2). Within a bucket, original generation order (row-major) is preserved, making the AI deterministic when scores tie.

- Early cutoffs
  - After making a move, `didLastMoveWin(...)` short-circuits to a terminal score without deeper recursion.
  - If only one empty square remains, return `TIE_SCORE` immediately.
  - `boardScore(...)` quickly detects row/column/diagonal wins and tie/full-board states; otherwise returns `CONTINUE_SCORE`.

- Opening heuristic
  - On an empty board, `getAiMove(...)` plays the center without searching. For even-sized boards, it picks the square at indices `(BOARD_SIZE/2, BOARD_SIZE/2)` (0-based), i.e., the lower-right of the central 2×2.

### Public function highlights

- `void getAiMove(char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE], char aiPlayer, int* out_row, int* out_col)`
  - Returns `(-1, -1)` if the position is already terminal (win or tie) for either side.
  - Otherwise, orders moves and runs a full-depth alpha–beta search (first reply via `miniMaxLow`) to pick the best move. If a top-level immediate win is found, it is returned directly.

- `static int boardScore(const char board[...], char aiPlayer)`
  - Evaluates only for terminal detection: returns `AI_WIN_SCORE`/`PLAYER_WIN_SCORE` based on who completed a line relative to `aiPlayer`, `TIE_SCORE` if full and no winner, or `CONTINUE_SCORE` when moves remain.

## Key sources

- Engine: [`src/MiniMax/mini_max.c`](src/MiniMax/mini_max.c), [`src/MiniMax/mini_max.h`](src/MiniMax/mini_max.h)
- Game/UI scaffolding: [`src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.c`](src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.c), [`src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.h`](src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.h)
- Entry point & self-play: [`src/main.c`](src/main.c)
- Build: [`Makefile`](Makefile)

## Build and run

Requirements:

- GCC or Clang compatible with C11

Common targets:

- Build (release by default): `make`
- Run: `make run`
- Debug build: `make debug`
- Release build: `make release`
- Clean: `make clean`

Release build flags include:

- `-O3 -march=native -flto -fomit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG -fno-plt`

### Build without Make (manual)

You can compile directly with gcc or clang. The commands below produce the same `ttt` binary name as the Makefile.

- Release (gcc):

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O3 -march=native -flto -fomit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG -fno-plt -pipe \
  src/main.c src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.c src/MiniMax/mini_max.c -o ttt
```

- Debug (gcc):

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O0 -g -pipe \
  src/main.c src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.c src/MiniMax/mini_max.c -o ttt
```

- Using clang: replace `gcc` with `clang`.

Run the binary:

```sh
./ttt
```

### Change board size

`BOARD_SIZE` defaults to 3 in `src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.h`. You can override at compile time, e.g.:

```sh
make CFLAGS+='-DBOARD_SIZE=4'
```

…or by editing `BOARD_SIZE` in [`tic_tac_toe.h`](src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.h).

Note: The search space grows exponentially with board size. Alpha–beta plus move ordering helps, but very large boards still require additional techniques (e.g., TT caching) for speed.

To override `BOARD_SIZE` without Make, pass `-DBOARD_SIZE=4` (example) to the compile command, e.g.:

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O3 -march=native -flto -fomit-frame-pointer -DNDEBUG -fno-plt -pipe \
  -DBOARD_SIZE=4 \
  src/main.c src/TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.c src/MiniMax/mini_max.c -o ttt
```

## CLI usage

Interactive game:

- Run the compiled `ttt` binary (or `make run`) and follow prompts to play as X or O.

Self-play benchmark mode:

- `--selfplay [games] [--quiet]`
  - Example: `./ttt --selfplay 10000 --quiet`
  - Without `--quiet`, timing and throughput (games/s) are printed.
  - Short flags are supported: `-s` for `--selfplay`, `-q` for `--quiet`.
  - If `[games]` is omitted, the default is `1000`.

## Using the engine

Minimal example:

```c
#include "TicTacToe/tic_tac_toe.h"
#include "MiniMax/mini_max.h"

char board[BOARD_SIZE][BOARD_SIZE];
initializeBoard();

// ... populate board with current position ...

int r = -1, c = -1;
getAiMove(board, /* aiPlayer */ 'x', &r, &c);
// If r,c are -1,-1 the position was terminal; otherwise play (r,c)
```
